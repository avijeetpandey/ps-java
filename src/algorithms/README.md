## Algorithms :tada: :rocket"
Algorithms are finite set of instructions , required to solve a given problem, also the steps should be finite and the algorithm should not be ambiguos.

### Analysis of algorithms
Analysis of algorithms means comparing two different set of algorithms with respect to space , time etc.
There are two types of analysis
- `Priory` - analysis before execution ( this gives approximate value , but is independent )
- `Pasterior` - analysis after execution ( this gives exact value , but depends upon the hardware/software )

### Asymptotic Notation
Asymptotic notations are a mathematical way of representing the time complexity of an algorithm , they are of 3 types mainly
- Big O - takes into account of worst case and nearest upper bound value
- Big Omega - takes into account of the best case and lower bound value
- Theta notation - takes into account of the average case and exact time to execute the algorithm


There are three properties of asymptotic notations
- Reflexive
- Symmetric
- Transitive

### Comparison of time complexities

```
O(c) < O(log logn) < O(logn) < O(n1/2) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(N^2) < O(N^3) < O(N^K) < O(2^N)
```

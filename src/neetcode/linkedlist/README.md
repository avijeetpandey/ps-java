# Linkedlist

Problems with array ?

- Array stores in sequential order
- Either the space is fixed or pre-allocateds
- Insertion in the middle is costly, same in the beginning
- Deletion in the middle or beginning is costly
- Implementation of queues or stacks is complex

LinkedList solves all of the issues and is a linear data structure , the elements are not stored in a contigious manner.

`Worst case complexity` - **O(1)**
